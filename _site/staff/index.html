Dr Orbuck has been working with us for the last 4 years. After completing his Bachelor of Dental Science Degree at the University of Western Australia, Reece moved to Bunbury and spent four years providing treatment to the community in and around Bunbury.</p>

<p>Reece was born in Victoria where he spent his younger years in the town of Torquay before moving to Perth with his family where he completed his high school education, achieving outstanding results.</p>

<p>He is skilled in all facets of preventive and general operative dentistry, including the treatment of all age groups. He has developed an interest in the special areas of Endodontic and Prosthodontic treatment. He also has a keen interest in innovative new technologies as they apply to Dentistry, and currently spends much of his non-surgical time at the development level.</p>

<p>The remainder of this time is spent on the tennis court developing a rather intimidating forehand.</p>

Colleen’s friendly face has welcomed you to Sorrento Dental since 1990. As our practice manager and head receptionist, Colleen keeps the practice running smoothly each day, all while making appointment bookings. Colleen also has extensive experience chair-side, having trained as a dental clinical assistant in Busselton, which gives her the insight to assess many presenting conditions and schedule your appointments appropriately, as well as preparing the clinicians to manage your case.</p>

<p>Colleen was born and raised in Western Australia, and completed her schooling in Busselton.</p>

<p>Outside of business hours Colleen is an avid nature photographer, and some of her best shots are on display around the clinic. She recently took an amazing holiday to Iceland and the United Kingdom, and we look forward to putting up some of the incredible images she took while she was away.</p>

<p>Colleen is passionate about providing great service to our patients and brings about a positive and friendly atmosphere throughout the entire practice.</p>

<p>In the Summer Tegan loves Paddleboarding and spends many weekend with her family and 4WD, exploring WA and camping. She is hoping to travel a little further from home in the future, to maybe visit Japan and see snow for the first time!</p>

Trish is works Monday through Thursday at Sorrento dental clinic, chair side as a dental clinical assistant. She has been with us since 2005, following a career working as a flight attendant for qantas. Her hospitality skills are invaluable to us, and she excels at making your experience more comfortable and engaging when you come to visit us for an appointment.</p>

<p>Trish has Sicilian heritage, and speaks fluent Italian. She was raised here in WA and went to school in Lesmurdie. Currently, a Trish is looking forward to catching up with family on a European vacation in 2018.</p>

<p>Trish surprised us all in 2016, winning the Sorrento Dental staff footy tipping competition. Not really an AFL fan, it remain a mystery to this day (ahem…Dennis Cometti on the radio) how she managed to pull of that win!</p>
