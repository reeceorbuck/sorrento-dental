In 2023, we began a process of modernizing our equipment and technology to position the practice at the forefront of digital dentistry. 

This started with an intra-oral scanner, which is a small camera that is moved around the teeth and captures hundreds of images per second. These images are stitched together by AI to create a 3D model of your teeth and soft tissues. The scan has almost entirely replaced our need to take messy impressions, for everything from mouthguards to crowns.

We then aquired a 3d printer as well as a ceramic CAD milling machine. This allows us to fabricate dental study models, nightguards, retainers, crowns, veneers, bridges and more, all in house, based off of designs we have made on a computer ourselves. This allows for far more flexibility and control over the final result, as well as the ability to try and test our designs before finalization. It also means indirect ceramic restorations like crowns and partial crowns (onlays or veneers for example) can be completed in a single visit.

On a personal note, this transition into modern digital dentisty has me incredibly enthusiastic for all the new opportunities we can pursue at the practice. I've really fallen into a deep and exciting rabbit hole, that has truly energized my dentistry. The investments that I've made in the past 12 months are what I consider to be the absolute best equipment that is out there today, and as we continue to explore the wide range of applications, the entire team is buzzing about kinds of results we are getting.
