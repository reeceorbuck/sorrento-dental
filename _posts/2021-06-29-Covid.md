This page outlines the state of our operations during the ongoing COVID-19 situation. 

## UPDATE: 29th June 2021
*CLOSED*: Tuesday 29th June

*EXPECT CLOSED*: Wednesday 30th June - Friday 2nd July 2021

We have received and are complying with directives laid out by the Australian Dental Association and the Health Department late last night. Due to additional risks inherent in dental procedures they have implemented stringent restrictions (Level 4), and dental practices require specialised equipment in order to work safely. Therefore we are not able to open to patients until restrictions change, but we are currently looking in to which practices nearby are able to provide some emergency services.

Best wishes from the team at Sorrento Dental Clinic.

Regards,  
Dr Reece Orbuck and Dr Simon Kenrick
