Sorrento Dental Clinic accepts all major health funds, offering rebates that are claimable on the spot using our Hicaps system.  

We are HBF preferred providers, which means patients claiming from HBF will ensure they receive their maximum possible rebate, and lowest out-of-pocket costs for treatment. 

If supported, customers are also able to apply their health fund ‘Loyalty Bonus’ covering the complete cost of dental treatment.
