Welcome to Jekyll-Indieweb. The goal of this project was to provide someone without a web presence a quick and easy way to start using the basics of the [Indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com).

Currently supported are microformats, including an author h-card on the home page. Social media links are configurable in `_config.yml`. Where applicable, fill in either your profile link or nick name for each profile you wold like to link to. Remember, empty values will not show up in the h-card.

Also configurable is whether or not you would like to receive [webmentions](https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention) on your posts. Leave `webmentions:` blank. The built in support is for Voxpelli's [webmention end point](https://webmention.herokuapp.com). Simply register with the service and set the configuration to **yes**. Read further in the wiki about webmetnions.

Currently there isn't a simple method for sending webmentions with static blogs, especially hosted on GitHub, but as soon as a solution is in place, I will update this project. If you are adventurous, feel free to ping me in the  IRC channel and I can share my method.

Finally, I attempted to make the *design* of this project as un-opinionated as I could, but maintain an aesthetic that someone just starting out would comfortable with and still be able to easily customize.
