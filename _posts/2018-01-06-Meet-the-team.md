##### Colleen
Colleenâ€™s friendly face has welcomed you to Sorrento Dental since 1990. As our practice manager and head receptionist, Colleen keeps the practice running smoothly each day, all while making appointment bookings. Colleen also has extensive experience chair-side, having trained as a dental clinical assistant in Busselton, which gives her the insight to assess many presenting conditions and schedule your appointments appropriately, as well as preparing the clinicians to manage your case. 

Colleen was born and raised in Western Australia, and completed her schooling in Busselton. 

Outside of business hours Colleen is an avid nature photographer, and some of her best shots are on display around the clinic. She recently took an amazing holiday to Iceland and the United Kingdom, and we look forward to putting up some of the incredible images she took while she was away.

Colleen is passionate about providing great service to our patients and brings about a positive and friendly atmosphere throughout the entire practice.

##### Trish
Trish works Monday through Thursday at Sorrento dental clinic, chair side as a dental clinical assistant. She has been with us since 2005, following a career working as a flight attendant for qantas. Her hospitality skills are invaluable to us, and she excels at making your experience more comfortable and engaging when you come to visit us for an appointment.

Trish has Sicilian heritage, and speaks fluent Italian. She was raised here in WA and went to school in Lesmurdie. Currently, a Trish is looking forward to catching up with family on a European vacation in 2018.

Trish surprised us all in 2016, winning the Sorrento Dental staff footy tipping competition. As Trish is not really an AFL fan, it remains a mystery to this day (ahem...Dennis Cometti on the radio) how she managed to pull off that win!
